# Clothing-Price-Comparison-System
This is a simple clothing price comparison created as a part of miniproject in our academic curriculum.
A website named The Forge helps people to compare and contrast between different local clothing brands, reduces the effort to go through different platforms thereby secure customers time.
The web application is a great perk to small scale local clothing brands as they get more exposure, in the fast forwarding fashion industry.
The team members include Varsha K, Nisma Reyasath, Mehreen Fathima B, and lalithya Dev
